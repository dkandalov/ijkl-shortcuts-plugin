 - in commit dialog button mnemonics take precedence over navigation (e.g. alt-o for "optimise imports" checkbox)
 - check "Use camelhump words" setting and suggest to set it in popup notification
 
 - shortcuts mostly don't work in the main menu
 - shortcuts don't work in navigation bar (Main menu -> View -> Navigation Bar);
   but work fine when navigation bar is displayed as popup 
 - alt-m doesn't work in new file/package dialog
